Project Description:

I have developed a powerful HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, offering a concise yet comprehensive overview of crucial workforce metrics. 
The dashboard includes:
- Genderwise Attrition
- Active Employees
- Overall Attrition
- Department-wise Attrition
- Average Age of Employees
- Job Satisfaction metrics.
-  This tool facilitates data-driven decision-making, identifies trends, enhances employee engagement, and aids in the formulation of effective retention strategies. The user-friendly interface ensures accessibility for various stakeholders, making it a valuable asset for strategic HR planning.
